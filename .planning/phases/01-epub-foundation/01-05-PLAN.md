<objective>
Perform end-to-end testing and validation of the complete EPUB Foundation CLI functionality.

Purpose: Verify that all components work together correctly — file discovery, EPUB parsing, metadata extraction, word counting, table output, error handling, and results generation (both markdown and JSON with word_count per OUT-04). This is the final validation before Phase 1 is considered complete.

Output: Validated, working CLI that meets all Phase 1 success criteria including OUT-04 (JSON output with word_count) and CFG-02 (./results/ output folder).

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete Phase 1 CLI implementation with all features from Plans 01-04, including JSON output with word_count (OUT-04)</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Verify help text displays correctly:
   ```bash
   node dist/cli/index.js --help
   ```
   Expected: Shows all options (--input, --verbose, --recursive) with descriptions

3. Create test environment:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p epubs
   # Add at least 2-3 valid EPUB files to epubs/ folder
   # (Use any EPUB files you have available)
   ```

4. Test default processing (./epubs/ folder):
   ```bash
   node dist/cli/index.js
   ```
   Expected: Table displays with filename, word count, title, author columns

5. Verify output files created (per CFG-02, folder is ./results/):
   ```bash
   ls -la results/
   ```
   Expected: results.md, results.json, and errors.log (if any errors) exist

6. Review results.md:
   ```bash
   cat results/results.md
   ```
   Expected: Summary section with counts, table of successful EPUBs, list of any failures

7. Review results.json (verify OUT-04 - word_count field):
   ```bash
   cat results/results.json
   ```
   Expected: JSON with "generated_at", "summary" object, "epubs" array where each epub has "word_count" field, and "failed" array

8. Test single file mode:
   ```bash
   node dist/cli/index.js epubs/your-file.epub
   ```
   Expected: Processes only the specified file

9. Test recursive flag (if you have subdirectories with EPUBs):
   ```bash
   node dist/cli/index.js --recursive
   ```
   Expected: Scans subdirectories for .epub files

10. Test verbose mode:
    ```bash
    node dist/cli/index.js --verbose
    ```
    Expected: More detailed output during processing

11. Verify .gitignore:
    ```bash
    git status
    ```
    Expected: epubs/, results/, dist/, node_modules/ are NOT shown as untracked

Optional - Test error handling:
- Add a non-EPUB file renamed to .epub (e.g., copy text.txt to fake.epub)
- Run CLI and verify it continues processing, logs error to stderr and errors.log

OUT-04 Verification (important):
- Confirm results.json contains "word_count" field for each EPUB
- Word count should be numeric value matching the table output

After checkpoint approval:
1. All success criteria from ROADMAP.md Phase 1 are met
2. User can run CLI with various configurations
3. Output files (results.md, results.json, errors.log) are created correctly in ./results/ per CFG-02
4. results.json contains word_count field per OUT-04
5. Help text is clear and comprehensive
6. Error handling works as expected
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. User can run `epub-counter` (via `node dist/cli/index.js`) to process EPUBs
2. User receives word count and metadata for each processed EPUB
3. Tool handles malformed EPUBs gracefully without crashing
4. User can specify custom input folder via --input or positional arguments
5. Help text documents all CLI arguments clearly
6. results.md and results.json are created in ./results/ folder per CFG-02
7. results.json contains word_count field for each EPUB per OUT-04
8. --recursive flag enables subdirectory scanning
9. --verbose flag provides detailed output
10. ./epubs/ and ./results/ are gitignored
11. All Phase 1 requirements from ROADMAP.md are satisfied
</success_criteria>
