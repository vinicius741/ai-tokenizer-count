## Future Requirements

Deferred to future milestones.

### Advanced Features

- Drag-and-drop EPUB upload (bypass server filesystem)
- Advanced knapsack solver for optimal budget maximization
- Server-side folder browser with directory tree and EPUB count badges
- Per-chapter token breakdown
- Streaming/chunked tokenization for large EPUBs
- Tokenizer caching for repeated runs

### Infrastructure

- User authentication
- Cloud storage integration
- Database persistence
- Docker/containerization
- Multi-user collaboration

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| DRM handling | Legal complexity, tool skips DRMed EPUBs with warning |
| Text file export | Users want counts, not extracted text |
| EPUB modification | Tool is read-only analyzer only |
| Other document formats (PDF, DOCX) | EPUB only for v2.0 |
| Real-time watch mode | Manual execution only |
| User authentication | Localhost-only access for v2.0 |
| Websockets for progress | SSE is sufficient, less complexity |
| EPUB content editing | Out of scope, tool is analyzer |
| Multi-user collaboration | Localhost-only, no backend database |
| Background job queue persistence | Immediate processing only |
| Custom tokenizer upload | Security risk, use Hugging Face models |
| Database persistence | File-based JSON storage is sufficient |
| Docker/containerization | npm start is sufficient for local development |
